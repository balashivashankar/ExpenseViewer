# ExpenseViewer
The Expense Viewer App is a lightweight iOS application built using SwiftUI with a hybrid Swift + Objective-C codebase. The app fetches expense data from a remote JSON endpoint, processes and transforms the response using Objective-C, and displays a sorted list of expenses in a modern SwiftUI interface.
